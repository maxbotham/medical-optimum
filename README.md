Hi there, this is the README document for helping you set up Max and Seher's project: Medical Optimum.

If not already installed, please look up and download the following things: Python 3, Node, and NPM.

Please enter the directory: ./API and enter the following command:

python API.py

You should see a message in your terminal saying the server is running.

Please create a new terminal window and navigate to the directory: ./web and enter the following command:

npm install

After this completes, please enter the following command:

npm start

Now, please download the following extension for google chrome:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en

Once installed, please follow the extension's instructions to disable CORS. Once this is complete, you should be able to navigate to

localhost:3000, and view the frontend. 

Alternately, you can query the backend at localhost:5000

Please contact me at maxbotham@gmail.com if you have any troubles with any of these instructions.
